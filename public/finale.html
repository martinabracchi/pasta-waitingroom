'Did you know that the invention of pasta dates way back, even before the ancient Romans? We have proof that the Etruscan ate a dish that is the ancestor of today’s lasagna (lagana) indeed the tools to prepare the sheets of pasta were found inside their tombs.',
//2
'The first instance of “pastasciutta” dates back to the XII century, in Sicily, during the Arabian domination. In the region of Trabia so much pasta was produced that it was exported to Calabria and “to many other Muslim and Christian lands”.',
//3
'Pastasciutta was typical of the southern regions of Italy, and liguria, where the air is dried and the pasta can naturally air dry outdoors. While in the northern regions, where the weather is more humid, pasta was made with eggs and had often a filling (like cappelletti or ravioli)',
//4
'Pasta became a food for the masses only starting from the XVII century, following the great famine in the Kingdom of Naples. People couldn’t buy bread, let alone meat, so they began consuming pasta, which had become more affordable thanks to the inventions of the die machine and the press ',
//5
'The taste for pasta “al dente” was developed in the XVII century, while before that pasta was often overcooked, softer and more difficult to digest',
//6
'Already in the XVIII century, the neapolitans gained the nickname of “mangiamacheroni” which was only used for the Sicilians up until then. Pasta became a national symbol in italy. Italian playwright Carlo Goldoni when he was in Paris heard people say: “you want to feed soup to an italian? Italians eat nothing but maccheroni, maccheroni, maccheroni”',
//7
'It was in the XVII century that pasta became associated with the famous tomato sauce, in the Kingdom of Naples. Tomato had been brought back to Europe from the “new world” and was already renowned and appreciated in many preparations',
//8
'The noun pasta comes from the late latin (păsta) and from the greek (πάστη - paste) and it means flour mixed with water and salt. The word maccheroni, instead, comes from the etruscan word “makària” or “makarṓnia”, which means blessed food, it was offered during funerary cerimonies',
